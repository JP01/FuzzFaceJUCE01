Fuzzed is an analogue modelling distortion plugin, using "state of the art" state-space modelling techniques to model the physical circuitry of the famous Jimi Hendrix guitar pedal and implement it as a VST plugin using the JUCE API.

Rather than simply modelling the general behaviour of the pedal, this plugin uses the circuit schematic to construct a highly accurate simulation of the pedal's behaviour, with full parametric control. This is then implemented as a VST plugin for use in real time.
Included are some analysis screenshots of the comparisons between the output of the system and the real pedal, which shows the behaviour of the VST to be highly comparable to the real thing.

Use of Fuzzed as a return effect can add beautiful analogue distortion to your sounds without losing the original tonal content.

This work is the result of continued development of a plugin created and submitted as part of an individual university project.
